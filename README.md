# Data-Structures-Algorithms

**Data Structures and Algorithms :**
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms.
It serves as a resource for learning and understanding fundamental concepts 
in computer science.

**Overview :**
Data structures and algorithms are essential components of computer science and software development. 
Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. This repository aims 
to provide clear and concise implementations of common data structures and algorithms, along with 
explanations of their functionality and usage.

**Contents :**
Data Structures: Includes implementations of commonly used data structures such as arrays, linked lists, 
stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, and hash tables.

**Algorithms :** 
Contains implementations of classic algorithms for sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and more.
Implementations are provided in various programming languages, allowing developers to explore and compare different approaches and
language-specific features.

**Contributions :**
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or additional implementations to contribute, please follow the guidelines outlined
in CONTRIBUTING.md.

**Usage :**
Feel free to use the code in this repository for educational purposes, personal projects, or as a reference for coding interviews. However,
it's important to understand the concepts behind each implementation rather than just copying the code.
